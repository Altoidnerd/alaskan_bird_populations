# Weather based prediction of the populations of the black-capped chickadee and bald eagle in alaska

The principle files are ipython workbooks:

### data preparation

* `ML/data_prep.ipynb`
* `ML/data_prep2.ipynb`

### models

* `ML/chickadee_model.ipynb`
* `ML/bald_eagle_model.ipynb`

### other files

Everthing else is mostly intermediate outputs I used while preparing the unstructured dataset.
